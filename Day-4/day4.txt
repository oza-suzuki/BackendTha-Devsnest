1. REST
REST (short for ‘Representational State Transfer’) is a web services API. REST APIs are a key part in modern web applications, including Netflix, Facebook, and many others.


2. RPC
An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs are the oldest and simplest types of API. The goal of an RPC is for the client to execute code on a server. The main benefit of RPC APIs is they make it easier for developers to create applications involving multiple programs or services.

3. A SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) API is similar to REST in that it’s a type of Web API.

SOAP entered the web development scene in the late 1990s, around the time service oriented architecture (SOA) took-off. SOAP was the first to standardize the way applications should use network connections to manage services.
